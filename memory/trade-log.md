# Trade Log

Format per entry: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM IST | INSTRUMENT | DTE | action | strikes | credit/debit | qty | reason`

Log every trade placed, closed, or skipped (and why) — including a skipped trade when a guardrail
blocked it. Keep entries short (1-3 lines). Tail the last ~20 entries when reading this file in a
routine; don't re-read the whole history every time.

**Always include DTE-at-entry**, especially for BANKNIFTY — it's the unvalidated instrument (see
memory/strategy.md and memory/signals-learnings.md) and its results must be assessable separately
from NIFTY/SENSEX, which needs DTE visible per trade, not just instrument name.

that actually evaluates a setup.)_
