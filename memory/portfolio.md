# Portfolio Snapshot

_Last updated: 2026-07-07 intraday-monitor — flat, 0 open positions, nothing to manage; no trade. All 3 indices still trending (NIFTY ADX 30.61 / BANKNIFTY 27.55 / SENSEX 30.34, all ≥18; VIX 11.82), data unchanged from pre-market (no new bar) → no index setup; 18 F&O stocks read range-bound but stock options remain GATED per strategy.md (no authorization) → no stock entry. Circuit breaker not tripped. Cash unchanged ₹99,400. Prior line: 2026-07-07 pre-market scan — flat, no trade; all 3 indices trending, 18 stocks range-bound (logged for awareness). Prior line: 2026-07-06 EOD square-off (~15:15 IST) — flat into the close, 0 open positions, **0 trades today** (no-trade day). Every 07-06 intraday run skipped: all three trended hard the whole session (ADX rose through ~19→34 as spot drifted up, VIX extremely low ~11.8-11.9 but ADX is the binding gate) — no ADX<18 qualifier at any point; BANKNIFTY briefly dipped near the gate pre-market (12.75) but climbed well above it (19→34) intraday. Day P&L ₹0, cash unchanged ₹99,400. Circuit breaker not tripped. `square-off-all` → only the expired sid=71472 artifact SELL, REJECTED (known clean terminal reject, "Fund Limit Insufficient", not a strategy position). Prior line: 2026-07-06 intraday-monitor (~late-session IST) — flat; no ADX qualifier (NIFTY 32.76 / BANKNIFTY 33.97 / SENSEX 34.48, all ≥18; VIX 11.86). Prior line: 2026-07-06 intraday-monitor — flat; no ADX qualifier (NIFTY 40.30 / BANKNIFTY 38.58 / SENSEX 40.40, all ≥18; VIX 11.91). Prior line: 2026-07-06 intraday-monitor — flat; no ADX qualifier (NIFTY 39.52 / BANKNIFTY 38.98 / SENSEX 38.54, all ≥18; VIX 11.93). Prior line: 2026-07-06 intraday-monitor — flat; no ADX qualifier (NIFTY 35.12 / BANKNIFTY 33.83 / SENSEX 35.69, all ≥18; VIX 11.89). Prior line: 2026-07-06 intraday-monitor — flat; no ADX qualifier (NIFTY 31.55 / BANKNIFTY 27.98 / SENSEX 31.90, all ≥18; VIX 11.83). Prior line: 2026-07-06 intraday-monitor (~intraday IST) — flat; no ADX qualifier (NIFTY 26.66 / BANKNIFTY 19.10 / SENSEX 28.67, all ≥18; VIX 11.94). Prior line: 2026-07-03 EOD square-off (~15:15 IST) — flat into the close, 0 open positions, **0 trades that day** (no-trade day). Every 07-03 intraday run skipped: NIFTY/SENSEX trended all session (ADX rose ~26→44 / ~32→49 as spot drifted up, VIX extremely low ~11.9); BANKNIFTY was the only ADX qualifier (13-17<18) but skipped every run on DTE grounds (nearest expiry 2026-07-28 = ~25 DTE monthly, not the ≤7-DTE near-expiry point that is its sole rationale). Day P&L ₹0, cash unchanged ₹99,400. Circuit breaker not tripped. `square-off-all` → only the expired sid=71472 artifact SELL, REJECTED (known clean terminal reject, not a strategy position). Prior line: 2026-07-02 EOD square-off — both ICs force-closed (SENSEX #2 −₹568.80, NIFTY #3 −₹61.10), day P&L −₹629.90._

- **Cash (tracked virtual):** ₹99,400.00 (100,029.90 − 629.90 realized today)
- **Realized P&L (all-time):** −₹600.00 (was +₹29.90; −₹629.90 today)
- **Today's P&L (2026-07-06):** ₹0 — no-trade day (no ADX<18 qualifier all session; came in flat, opened nothing, closed nothing). Circuit breaker not tripped.

Position #2 close (2026-07-02 EOD): cost-to-close 165.86/unit via Black-Scholes (spot ~77,511,
VIX 12.26, DTE 7): buy-back SP77100PE 313.73 + SC77500CE 572.17 − sell LP76900PE 247.89 −
LC77700CE 472.15 = 165.86/unit. Realized = (161.12−165.86)×120 = **−₹568.80**. Spot drifted to
77,511, just above the 77500 upper short (call side went slightly ITM). Neither profit target
(≤80.56) nor SL (≥322.24) hit → forced EOD square-off. Broker close not possible (DH-906 BSE
connectivity / DH-905) — paper close is authoritative.

VIX 12.26, DTE 5): buy-back SP24000PE 61.03 + SC24200CE 137.64 − sell LP23900PE 36.95 −
LC24300CE 93.50 = 68.22/unit. Realized = (67.75−68.22)×130 = **−₹61.10**. Spot 24,175 sat just
above the 24200 upper short. Neither profit target (≤33.88) nor SL (≥135.50) hit → forced EOD
square-off. Broker close not possible (DH-905) — paper close is authoritative.

Position #1 close (2026-07-01 EOD): cost-to-close 71.78/unit via Black-Scholes (spot ~24,008,
VIX 13.3, DTE 6): buy-back SP23950PE 125.50 + SC24150CE 111.20 − sell LP23850PE 87.72 −
LC24250CE 77.20 = 71.78/unit. Realized = (72.01−71.78)×130 = **+₹29.90**. Broker close not
possible (DH-905 blocks current weekly securityIds) — paper close is authoritative.

## Notes

**Missed trades (broker blocked, paper position NOT logged at the time — pre-restructure):**
- 2026-07-01 ~09:34 IST: SENSEX ADX 17.09, IC 76600/76400/77000/77200, entry blocked by
  sandbox margin (₹934k locked by expired sid=71472 artifact). Not logged as paper position
  (portfolio.md-first logic not yet deployed at that time).
- 2026-07-01 ~11:43 IST: NIFTY ADX 16.08, IC 23800/23900/24100/24200, 2 lots, ~₹3,637 max
  loss. Blocked by DH-905 (sandbox OMS rejects current weekly securityIds — instrument
  universe appears frozen). Not logged as paper position (same reason — fix not yet deployed).

**Broker status (Dhan sandbox):** Two stacked blockers as of 2026-07-01 make sandbox unusable
— DH-906 margin locked (₹934k utilizedAmount) AND DH-905 unknown securityIds for current
weekly contracts. Broker column will show REJECTED but paper positions are tracked here
regardless — broker is best-effort only in paper mode. When switching to real trading,
live Dhan credentials (Client ID 1112363387, api.dhan.co) replace sandbox credentials.

From the next qualifying setup onward, portfolio.md is written FIRST and broker order is
best-effort only.
